# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Philosophy

*   **A Gift to the Community:** You must ensure that your contribution is a voluntary act of giving. By contributing, you agree that your work is provided freely and can be incorporated into the project.
*   **Your Ideas are Welcome:** We welcome any and all opinions about the repository. The maintainer will do their best to consider every idea. We believe that open discussion is key to the project's success and strive to create an environment where every voice can be heard.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
*   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at [fireworkrocket@126.com](mailto:fireworkrocket@126.com). The maintainer will review all complaints and take appropriate action.

The maintainer is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
